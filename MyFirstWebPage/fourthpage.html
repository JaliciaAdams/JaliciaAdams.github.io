<p> Finn was in shock he couldn’t believe he had found it he couldn’t wait to go back and tell the whole village what he had found Finn climbs up the hill back into the cave and followed his trail of bread back to the village</p>

<P>Once Finn arrives back at the village everyone was shocked to see him they were worried sick about him he told them about his adventure and how he found the lost city of gold no one believes him. How could a boy who can barely tie his shoe find the lost city of gold when the men of the village were searching for years? </P>

<p>Many days and nights as past  Finn tries to convince the men of the village he can show them where the gold is but they would not budge 
One day the men’s got tired of Finn’s constant bickering they decide to let him lead the way on the next search </P>
